# Architecture Notes

## Files and Their Purpose

- `package.json`: Project manifest. Defines dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the Node.js/Electron app.
- `main.js`: Electron main process. Responsible for creating the application window and loading the UI.
- `index.html`: Minimal placeholder UI loaded by Electron. Will be expanded in future steps.
