# Progress Log

## Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Initialized a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`.
- Installed Electron as a dev dependency (`npm install --save-dev electron`).
- Created `main.js` as the Electron main process file to open a window.
- Added a minimal placeholder UI in `index.html`.
- Added a `start` script to `package.json` to launch the app with Electron.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that a window opens displaying the app name and a placeholder message.

## Step 2: UI Grid Selection (Completed)
- Added three radio buttons to the UI for grid selection: "Most Played", "High Win Rate", and "D2PT Rating".
- Added a display area below the radio buttons to show the currently selected grid.
- Implemented minimal JavaScript to update the display live as the user changes their selection.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that the app window shows the three grid options.
- Select each option and confirm the "Selected" display updates accordingly.

## Step 3: UI Download & Update Button (Completed)
- Added a "Download & Update" button below the grid selection in the UI.
- Implemented a click event handler for the button that logs a message to the console when clicked.
- Updated the placeholder text to indicate Step 3 progress.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that the app window shows the "Download & Update" button below the grid selection.
- Click the button and confirm that a message is logged to the console (open Developer Tools with Ctrl+Shift+I to view the console).

## Step 4: UI Status Area (Completed)
- Added a status area below the "Download & Update" button in the UI (`index.html`).
- Implemented a function to display notifications and operation results in the status area.
- When the button is clicked, a test notification appears in the status area and disappears after a few seconds.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Click the "Download & Update" button.
- Verify that a green notification appears in the status area and then disappears after a few seconds.

## Step 5: UI SteamID & Config Path Display (Completed)
- Added a new section below the status area in `index.html` to display the detected SteamID and config folder path.
- For this step, test values are hardcoded in the UI and set via JavaScript for demonstration purposes.
- The section includes two lines: one for SteamID and one for the config path, both using placeholder values.
- This prepares the UI for future integration with real detection logic in later steps.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that the app window shows a SteamID and config path below the status area.
- Confirm that the displayed values match the test values set in the script.
