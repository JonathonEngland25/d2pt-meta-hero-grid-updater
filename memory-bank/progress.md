# Progress Log

## Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Initialized a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`.
- Installed Electron as a dev dependency (`npm install --save-dev electron`).
- Created `main.js` as the Electron main process file to open a window.
- Added a minimal placeholder UI in `index.html`.
- Added a `start` script to `package.json` to launch the app with Electron.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that a window opens displaying the app name and a placeholder message.
