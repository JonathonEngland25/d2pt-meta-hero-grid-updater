# Progress Log

## Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Initialized a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`.
- Installed Electron as a dev dependency (`npm install --save-dev electron`).
- Created `main.js` as the Electron main process file to open a window.
- Added a minimal placeholder UI in `index.html`.
- Added a `start` script to `package.json` to launch the app with Electron.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that a window opens displaying the app name and a placeholder message.

## Step 2: UI Grid Selection (Completed)
- Added three radio buttons to the UI for grid selection: "Most Played", "High Win Rate", and "D2PT Rating".
- Added a display area below the radio buttons to show the currently selected grid.
- Implemented minimal JavaScript to update the display live as the user changes their selection.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that the app window shows the three grid options.
- Select each option and confirm the "Selected" display updates accordingly.

## Step 3: UI Download & Update Button (Completed)
- Added a "Download & Update" button below the grid selection in the UI.
- Implemented a click event handler for the button that logs a message to the console when clicked.
- Updated the placeholder text to indicate Step 3 progress.

**How to test:**
- Run `npm start` in the project directory.
- Verify that the app window shows the "Download & Update" button below the grid selection.
- Click the button and confirm that a message is logged to the console (open Developer Tools with Ctrl+Shift+I to view the console).
